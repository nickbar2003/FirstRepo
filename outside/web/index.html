  <h4>Prayers of the Rosary</h4>
  <p>The Apostles' Creed</p>
  <p>I believe in God,
    the Father almighty,
    Creator of heaven and earth,
    and in <span>Jesus</span> Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
    who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
    born of the Virgin Mary,
    suffered under Pontius Pilate,
    was crucified, died and was buried;
    he descended into hell;
    on the third day he rose again from the dead;
    he ascended into heaven,
    and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;
    from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.</p>
  <p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,
    the holy catholic Church,
    the communion of saints,
    the forgiveness of sins,
    the resurrection of the body,
    and life everlasting. Amen</p>
  <p>The Doxology</p>
  <p>Glory be to the Father
    and to the Son
    and to the Holy Spirit,
    as it was in the beginning
    is now, and ever shall be
    world without end. Amen.</p>
  <p>The Fatima Prayer:</p>
  <p>O my <span>Jesus</span>, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell,
    and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy.</p>
  <p>The Lord's Prayer</p>
  <p>Our Father who art in heaven,
    hallowed be thy name.
    Thy kingdom come,
    Thy will be done
    on earth, as it is in heaven.
    Give us this day our daily bread,
    and forgive us our trespasses,
    as we forgive those who trespass against us,
    and lead us not into temptation,
    but deliver us from evil.
    Amen.</p>
  <p>The Hail Mary</p>
  <p>Hail, Mary, full of grace,
    the Lord is with thee.
    Blessed art thou among women
    and blessed is the fruit of thy
    womb, Jesus.
    Holy Mary, Mother of God,
    pray for us sinners,
    now and at the hour of our death.
    Amen.</p>
  <p>The Salve Regina</p>
  <p>Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children
    of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, O most gracious
    Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb,
    Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

    Lead: Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.
    Response: That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.</p>
