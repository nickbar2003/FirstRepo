    Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, 
    our life, our sweetness and our hope.
    To you do we cry,
    poor banished children of Eve. 
    To you do we send up our sighs, 
    mourning and weeping in this valley of tears 
    Turn then, most gracious advocate,
    your eyes of mercy toward us,
    and after this exile
    show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb,
    Jesus.
    O clement, O loving, 
    O sweet Virgin Mary.
    Pray for us O holy Mother of God,
    that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
    Amen.
