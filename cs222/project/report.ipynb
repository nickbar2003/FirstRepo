    "## Domain\n",
    "I have a paticular Interest in nature and things that grow. I also have a familial connection with Spain. I knew I wanted to study something relating to nature and agriculture excited me. To scope down my project I decided to qualify the scope to a single country, Spain. I felt that while many things impact carbon emission and pollution in a more general sense, that agriculture and livestock would have a paticular affect in emissions. The correlation between livestock production and emissions is perhaps to obvious and so I decided to focus on crop production.\n",

    "## The Datasets\n",
    "- For data on Spains agricultural production a data set was sourced from The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n",
    "- This source was very well documented which greatly aided in understanding attributes\n",
    "- This source provided a tool for specifcying the range and scope of data to download\n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The production of a certain crops in Spain during a year have a direct impact on Spains carbon emissions for that year. There is a crop type which has a greatest level of effect on carbon emissions so that as that crop is produced in higher quanities, carbon emissions grow as a direct result.\n",

    "\n",
    "- When collectng data for Spains agricultre the FOA provided a very useful tool for selecting data. One could greatly vary the topic and scope of the data. This tool was very valuable as rather than having to refine a large and poorly organized data set, I was able iterativly change the parameters of the download to suit the needs of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The inital idea was to look at individual crops. The number of crops produced however made this unweilding, so a final data set was settled upon that collected crop croups under the attribute title \"Item\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    - An item groups all crops into categoreis like cereal, fruits, vegetables, oil producing crops, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - This change afforded a more apporpriate scope and although graunality is lost, I believe more meaningful patterns will emerge.\n",

    "- Below shows an example of some of the more important attributes. Of paticular interests are the \"Item\" \"Year\" \"Element\" and \"Value\" of an instance.\n",

The data is yearly measurements of the overall production of each crop category for every year. The nature of this data frame would mean that removing outliers would be removing enitre years worth of data. In addition this data is simply recorindg the observed production value of each crop, if in a specific year a disproportionate amount of one crop was produced that data isn't neccisarliy incorrect. Though it may cause issues later when developing the model the decision was made to keep these outliers."

The first was effort was to train linear regression models for each category using the data from the five years before the missing data (2013-2017). Perhaps only using five years created an issues because the models were not producing satisfactory or \"beleivable\" results for the missing years' data.\n",

The second method was to take the mean of the five previous years for each crop type to generate a single year's production value. This process was repeated for every year. This means that the imputed data was being using to imput more data. \n",

The main reason this method was perfered was simply because the data produced did not greatly vary from the \"real\" instances before and after and continued the general trend that the \"real\" data was following."
