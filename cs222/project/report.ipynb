    "I have a paticular Interest in nature and things that grow. I also have a familial connection with Spain. I knew I wanted to study something relating to nature and agriculture excited me. To scope down my project I decided to qualify the scope to a single country, Spain. I felt that while many things impact carbon emission and pollution in a more general sense, that agriculture and livestock would have a paticular affect in emissions. The correlation between livestock production and emissions is perhaps to obvious and so I decided to focus on crop production.\n",

    "- For data on Spains agricultural production a data set was sourced from The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The production of a certain crops in Spain during a year have a direct impact on Spains carbon emissions for that year. There is a crop type which has a greatest level of effect on carbon emissions so that as that crop is produced in higher quanities, carbon emissions grow as a direct result.\n",

    "- When collectng data for Spains agricultre the FOA provided a very useful tool for selecting data. One could greatly vary the topic and scope of the data. This tool was very valuable as rather than having to refine a large and poorly organized data set, I was able iterativly change the parameters of the download to suit the needs of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The inital idea was to look at individual crops. The number of crops produced however made this unweilding, so a final data set was settled upon that collected crop croups under the attribute title \"Item\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    - An item groups all crops into categoreis like cereal, fruits, vegetables, oil producing crops, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - This change afforded a more apporpriate scope and although graunality is lost, I believe more meaningful patterns will emerge.\n",

    "- Below shows an example of some of the more important attributes. Of paticular interests are the \"Item\" \"Year\" \"Element\" and \"Value\" of an instance.\n",
